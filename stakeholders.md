The goal of the [Cash Improvement Proposal (CHIP) process](https://blog.bitjson.com/bitcoin-cash-upgrade-2023/#why-chips) is to coordinate upgrades to Bitcoin Cash without a central authority by developing proposals in a collaborative, public process.

**CHIP maintainers are expected to actively seek out stakeholders and demonstrate widespread ecosystem approval.**

This includes approval from node and virtual machine implementations, wallets, and other open source software projects, educational institutions and community initiatives, and industry actors like exchanges, miners, services, and other businesses.

The following statements have been submitted in support of this CHIP.

> The ‘Pay to Script’ CHIP bundles a few small related changes which are low-hanging fruit for improving contract development on BCH. The CHIP removes the non-standardness restrictions for custom locking scripts which improves usecases like Cauldron DEX contracts or ZCEs by not forcing these usecases to use P2SH for standardness. Further, the CHIP improves the ease of contract development by removing the 1650 input bytecode standardness limit and by increasing the maximum commitment length. The CHIP does not introduce any novel concepts but instead removes or relaxes current constraints. I fully support this CHIP for activation in May 2026!

> This is very exciting! Since CashTokens upgrade the smart contract ecosystem has moved past “send to address” flow to a flow where client-side app creates the transaction for the user. P2S will fit right in, and I expect that app builders will find P2S more convenient than P2SH. I fully endorse this CHIP for 2026 activation!
>
> I’d like to add that the gap between relay and consensus rules has been an obstacle to experimentation, and this is a great step towards closing that gap. I think what matters here is that the default is maximally permissive (consensus-limited only by DoS considerations) and then node operators & miners can further restrict it if they want, as opposed to status quo of being restrictive and then some operators may relax it and cause unexpected issues for everyone else. I hope to see OP_RETURN alignment next, as OP_RETURN outputs are a convenient place to define function bodies to be shared by many inputs.

> This CHIP helps align Standardness Rules with Consensus Rules, reducing edge-case complexity in BCH contract development and simplifying certain constructs.
>
> With this proposal, locking bytecode is no longer required to match specific patterns (P2PKH, P2SH20/32, P2PK, etc.). It also makes length requirements consistent across Standardness and Consensus, and increases the Token Commitment length from 40 bytes to 128 bytes.
>
> In my view, these changes are both sane and sensible, and I give this CHIP my full support and endorsement.

> **I endorse “CHIP-2024-12 P2S: Pay to Script (c144f03f)” for 2026 lock-in.**
>
> The P2S CHIP relaxes some transaction standardness rules to align them with consensus. The VM Limits make sure that contracts still stay within compute bounds. It also increases the token commitment length somewhat. The CHIP has the effect of simplifying transaction validation and allowing larger contracts to be more conveniently expressed.

> I wholly endorse CHIP 2024-12 P2S, CHIP 2021-05 Loops, CHIP 2025-05 Functions, and CHIP 2025-05 Bitwise.
>
> P2S - Liberalizes some limits that were only put in place as an emergency measure to plug potential DoS in the early days of Bitcoin BTC (holes that don't exist on BCH anymore). Being able to pay to scripts of up to 201 bytes directly simplifies so much in terms of contracts, and liberalizing lots of the other script limits (such as scriptSig being 10KB now) is extremely critical for smart contract development and only makes sense. Ditto for token commitments having more payload. The VMLimits upgrade of 2025 ensures this liberalization is safe and cannot be abused.
>
> Loops - Very conservative but crucial upgrade to the FORTH-like language that is the BCH VM, allowing for loops in script contract code in a very "forth" way (basically even the op-code names and semantics are ones used in some FORTH dialects). Will make some contract applications much more expressive and act as a form of "compression" to reduce contract bloat. VMLimits ensures loops are bounded and cannot hang anything or abuse computing resources beyond what is normal such as the cost of a signature check. No risk, high reward.
>
> Functions - Similarly, functions allow for code-reuse and reduce contract "bloat". They make some computations that would be awkward or incredibly difficult to achieve without functions, achievable in a single contract or contract series. VMLimits again ensure no abuse is possible. Should make porting contracts from e.g. EVM over to "CashVM" more achievable and tractable. Also makes BCH seem like a "real" programmable money chain and should create some developer delight. No risk, high reward, basically.
>
> Bitwise - Re-enables some op-codes that were emergency-disabled by Satoshi back in the day due to DoS concerns, and also adds a new set of bitwise OPs that didn't exist in original Satoshi Bitcoin that allow for alternate ways of doing bit manipulations (either binary or numeric). Due to the fact that we have VMLimits now to constrain expensive operations, will be zero-risk -- and high reward since bit manipulation is _very_ useful for programming in general and for some specialized BCH contracts in particular.
>
> Therefore I am very proud to have consulted on these CHIPs, to have implemented their proof of concept, and to be a "bcasher" and to see these activated in 2026. It's a wonderful time to be in BCH! Very cool!
>
> So yes. I support these upgrades and look forward to seeing them live on-chain in consensus as of mid-day May 15th, 2026.

> At first I was a bit skeptical regarding UTXO set growth, both regarding locking scripts that previously was implemented as P2SH(32) might now be significantly bigger and the increase of CashToken NFT commitments from 40 bytes to 128 bytes. Upon further review I think this change is net good. Fully endorse.
>
> One of the first use-cases that comes to my mind is that indexers can find certain contracts by just scanning the UTXO set instead of scanning spent transactions to find a mapping between contracts and redeem script hashes.

> The Bitcoin Cash Podcast is adding its support & approval for all 4 of the Jason Dreyzehner proposed CHIPs to lock-in November 15 2025 & go live May 15 2026 as the “Layla” upgrade. I will also be advocating as such regarding my involvement internally in Selene, BLISS & BLAZE and don’t anticipate any difficulties there, but this statement is not on behalf of those entities.

>
> As discussed on [The Bitcoin Cash Podcast Episode 157](https://youtu.be/h2xjYjqI7_Y?t=4033), community polling indicates a high appetite for protocol innovation & upgrades - presumably built on the confidence of previous upgrade quality & results. It is very noticeable how the CashTokens upgrade in 2023 is living up to expectations in late 2025. There has been no problems really to speak of & impressive traction/uptake of CashTokens technology. I have a biased favourite project in the BLISS NFT ticket collections, but the success of CashTokens is widespread and compelling. One excellent recent example, congratulations to the Riften Labs team on [recently passing $1M USD TVL on Cauldron](https://x.com/dagur/status/1963906886048022999)! The mounting success of the CashTokens ecosystem speaks to the quality of both research & implementation of BCH upgrades and the community’s ability to make powerful investments in those upgrades without expecting instant gratification. The trend is set to continue in 2026.
>
> Loops, Functions & Bitwise operations are all standard issue features of essentially every programming language ever so I’m glad to see the BCH VM catching up to that standard. Loops demonstrates that yet again the BCH community is able to bypass propaganda & misunderstandings (“Bitcoin VM has no loops”) in a way that other cryptocurrency communities severely struggle to. I was also impressed by the community debate that produced the final products (including iterating Functions from OP_EVAL, different function variations & the removal of lowering base-instruction cost). It is critical for the CHIP process & the work produced to be evaluated & critiqued without contention becoming unresolvable.
>
> I would also like to note I see an underrated value in the P2S CHIP specifically - moving P2S from non-standard relay policy to standard. Especially given the current drama in BTC over [policy/consensus gap exploitation (aka “Node wars” between “Knots/filters” vs “Core/spammers”)](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/non-standard-transactions-out-of-band-miner-submission/1257/24), I see a strong opportunity for BCH to once against front-run potential problems by a research effort (& possibly CHIP) to unify policy/consensus where appropriate or document the status/reasoning and reflect on alternative solutions where not. For instance, perhaps an ABLA/DAA style approach - either by consensus or policy - could be used for minimum fee rates? Needs investigation. BitcoinCashAutist (notable CHIP contributor) also mentioned this in [his 2026 CHIP endorsement](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/2026-layla-upgrade-lock-in-chip-endorsements-thread/1672/3). I encourage readers interested in this initiative to read or contribute to [my Bitcoin Cash Research thread](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/non-standard-transactions-out-of-band-miner-submission/1257) about this topic of non-standard transactions.
>
> In any case, the four endorsed CHIPs combined make a very powerful upgrade. I’m thrilled to see BCH making bold strides forward to accelerate our growing momentum & industry-leading presence in UTXO DeFi. I am also glad to be a part of the momentum around endorsements ([my own endorsement in 2024](https://bitcoincashpodcast.com/blog/chip-endorsement-may-2025) was not published until late October) & developer tooling/education (sign up to [BCH BLAZE](https://dorahacks.io/hackathon/bchblaze2025/detail)!).
>
> There is also great stuff on the horizon with the [1 minute blocks proposal](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/fablous) continuing [to be discussed](https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/chip-2025-03-faster-blocks-for-bitcoin-cash/1513/124). I would love to see UTXO Commitments start to be focussed on in more detail & the relay policy ideas mentioned above but that’s simply my wishful thinking - as always, a /someone problem!
>
> Finally, a big thank you to Jason Dreyzehner for his tireless work on these proposals & anyone who has been involved in feedback, review, implementation, testing or assistance of any kind. It’s a team effort and testament to a decentralised community but Jason also deserves specific recognition for his ceaseless effort here. Delivering two enormous upgrades back-to-back is an effort that will resonate through BCH history in perpetuity.

> Layla follows CashTokens & Velma in bringing BCH to the forefront of cryptocurrency scriptability and will draw in ever more interested parties as a result. I’m enthused & anticipating activation already!

> Although it has been possible to refer (or pay to) unnamed functions by their hashes, and it's also been possible to use loops by chaining logic as steps across multiple transactions, the work to formalize these capabilities as first-class features (within a single evaluation) should greatly simplify using functions and loops on Bitcoin Cash.

> \#\# Impacts from P2S: pay-to-script Proposal
>
> The P2S CHIP will impact Bitcoin Cash Futures markets, because the active coupon supply is currently being generated from chat messages in token commitments, and the change in maximum token commitment length from 40 to 128 bytes (https://github.com/bitjson/bch-p2s?tab=readme-ov-file#token-commitment-length) reduces the cost to chat from 250 sats per byte to 80 sats per byte.

> If activated, P2S will make chatting cheaper in vox channels, and reduce the number of coupons emitted per post, which can be expected to lower yield rates for FBCH series and lower the total locked value (TLV) in short term (T-10k) futures vaults.
>
> The P2S CHIP was released in Dec' 24, the FutureChan contract (controlling vox channels) was designed in Mar' 25. So the change in commitment length was known well in advance. Presumably, because it is an open market, folks will price in the change ahead of time, and sort out who will get the fewer coupons after the CHIP activates with the market.
>
> This source of coupons is currently fairly small, but the market may look very different in six months. Because vox channels emit coupons ten weeks in advance of a future maturing, the market impact wouldn't be until around August 1st 2026.
>
> \#\# Oracle development enabled by Bitwise Operation Codes
>
> The mining app for vox is currently blocked by a lack of bitwise operation codes in the VM.
>
> Each thread of the mining token contract will use bitwise operations to calculate current and previous difficulty targets from the current and previous transaction ids.
>
> Bitwise inversion will map the number of leading zeros on a transaction to a difficulty target. Bit shifts also allow for simple and cheap exponentiation, which will be use (along with OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY) for a difficulty adjustment algorithm.
>
> \# In short, the bitwise operation codes will be very useful for doing math that would otherwise get quite complex.

> I endorse all 4 CHIPs for $bch's 2026 lock-in: P2S, Functions, Loops, and Shifts.
>
> I was on the fence about functions but once I realized the foot gun argument applies even more to the eth vm which is the most widely used vm in crypto the argument stopped making sense to me.
>
> I think now the Bch Vm will be in a really good place and will become less of a priority.

> As an ecosystem supporter and a Fulcrum server operator, I wholly endorse CHIP 2024-12 P2S, CHIP 2021-05 Loops, CHIP 2025-05 Functions, and CHIP 2025-05 Bitwise.
>
> After reading through the incredibly thorough forum discussions, along with my one-on-one discussions with BCH devs, I have no concerns with the activation of these CHIPs nor with my infrastructure's ability to continue operating effectively. I fully expect that projects I've contributed to, as their respective devs have mentioned, will be able to make more than efficient and effective use of these upgrades.
>
> The substantial work in evaluating and building the tools and tests by Jason Dreyzehner [@bitjson](https://x.com/bitjson) and Calin Culianu [@cculianu](https://x.com/cculianu), along with everyone else's feedback, criticisms, and suggestions, is awe-inspiring - and I couldn't be more thankful to them and everyone's efforts.
>
> I hope to see all these CHIPs locked-in in November and activated next year!
>
> Once locked-in, I will have these upgrades and respective descriptions added to [minisatoshi.cash/upgrade-history](https://minisatoshi.cash/upgrade-history).

> While not ideal to bundle separate changes, each of the change listed here is either clear step towards bridging the gap between standardness and consensus enforcement, or is a reasonable adjustment to existing limits. As such, I endorse the CHIP-2024-12 P2S: Pay to Script for activation in May 2026.

> As we approach the lock-in for the May 2026 upgrade, discussion around the Functions CHIP has intensified with continued scrutiny and investigation. This has resulted in more understanding of the trade-offs involved and exploration of alternative approaches, allowing stakeholders to make an increasingly informed opinion.
>
> The deep work performed by Jason on creation of CHIPs has required significant effort to evaluate. It has also required discussion to elucidate a wide range of additional angles that increase confidence that all bases have been covered. That coverage has importantly included not only the immediate and longer term benefits, but also risks - more amorphous, harder to specify, and due to the one-way nature of consensus upgrades, critically important.
>
> General Protocols has been convinced that in the space of possible alternatives, including EVAL, modified versions of Functions and doing nothing, define/invoke is the best choice for BCH and endorses [CHIP-2025-05 Functions (Commit 26e2256)](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-functions/tree/26e22566a18f2f3b542ff46a70d258d5da585cd8) for 2026 activation.
>
> General Protocols also endorses the following CHIPs for 2026 activation:
>
> - [CHIP-2021-05 Loops (Commit bd3ebc7)](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-loops/tree/bd3ebc76bfa2190255fd3b5fcd84ec8910652f4e)
> - [CHIP-2024-12 P2S (Commit c144f03)](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-p2s/tree/c144f03fe11b6de0e924b2285b355370d0e658b8)
> - [CHIP-2025-05 Bitwise (Commit a432a19)](https://github.com/bitjson/bch-bitwise/tree/a432a19bcbc597391d0f0a29ae62a902b575d1dd)

> The 2026 BCH CHIPs - Loops, Functions, P2S & Bitwise - referred to as the "Layla" upgrade, completely unleashes the smart-contract capabilities of #BitcoinCash, making it the single-most sophisticated, UTXO-based, smart-contract chain in existence. This really opens up Defi, the BCH Virtual Machine, and possibly some privacy features in the future, as well. For this reason and FWIW, I fully endorse the 2026 CHIPs being pushed on May 15th, 2026.
